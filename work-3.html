I created this portfolio using HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. I emphasize using HTML5 because I wanted to get the semantics working so if webcrawlers go through my page, they will be able to pick out the important bits.

Given a screenshot of a website layout (wireframe.jpg) I just made a recreation of it using HTML5 and CSS. I used HTML5 in order to get the semantics as correct as possible so that web crawlers can accurately pick out the important bits of the page. But, because the screenshot was all in dummy text, I had to make guesses as to what was really important.
